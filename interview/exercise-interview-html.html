    <h2 id="C2">Conversation / Qustions</h2>
    <p>Here is some questions about web design also graphic design that asked Kallista Salim to answer.
      <h3>1.What is web design? ( What it means to be a web designer)</h3>
      <p>
        Web design refers to the designs that are displayed on the internet. I do not have any background on web design, but I think it involves creating the look, layout, and features of a website, which require for a web designer to understand both graphic design and computer programming.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2.What is the connections between graphic design & web design (In another word, why graphic designer should learn web design)</h3>
      <p>
        I believe that graphic design is a part of web design in its entirety. Good graphic design helps a website to appear more interesting. However, both the graphics and the programming must work well individually and together, in order to make a successful website. For example, if the graphics have been designed to fulfill a purpose, but the search engine, accessibility and usability have not, you do not have a web design, you just have some graphic design on the web.
      </p>

      <h3>3.Why and how people start to start thinking of designing website? (Purpose of web design)</h3>
      <p>
        Web design can serve as an aspect of a company that will leave an impression on the users/viewers. If a website is designed and managed properly, customers will continuously return to the site and do business with the company.
      </p>
      
      <h3>4.What kind of web design do you think is successful? (What is the important thing during starting design website)</h3>
      <p>
          A successful web design, I think, is a website thatâ€™s aesthetically pleasing, informative, and easy to navigate.
      </p>
      
      <h3>5.What is the differences between design for web(screen) and design for paper(printed)?</h3>
      <p>
          There are a lot of differenced between the print design and web design. The media itself is different and therefore provides different approaches on how the viewers/users receive the information. Print design is based on letting the eyes walk over the information, selectively looking at information objects and make page elements explain each other. Web design functions by letting the hands move over the information (by scrolling or clicking).
      </p>
      
      <h3>6.Through surfing on the internet, what parts do you think they must exist on a Web ( for example: search engine, menu....)</h3>
    <p>
        Personally, I think the most important part of a website is its content. It helps the designer of the web to work around the content and figure out how to create a successful design for a better user experience. A website without content does not really have a purpose.
    </p>

      <h3>7.How you experience being online changed over time?</h3>
      <p>
        Especially with the constant growth of technology, I feel like everything can be done and found online. It definitely provides convenience and everything seems easier and made simple.
